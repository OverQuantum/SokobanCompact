Notes:
1) Position file format slightly changed. To use old position files for load with exact level you need to change lines with LevelSet - "LevelSet = aenigma_txt" to "LevelSet = aenigma.txt" and so on, by analogue.
2) Prevent device from "going asleep" and reading charge level use low-level system functions. Please inform me in case of problems.


v0.5.3338.42204, 20.02.2009
* First publication
+ Convenient control by stylus/touchscreen - move around a level by 1 click, pushing boxes by 2 clicks (control by buttons is also available)
+ Manual zoom and scroll - you can solve large levels with normal zoom (see screenshots above)
+ Unlimited undo and redo
+ Saving and loading positions
+ Animated moving around a level and playing of solutions (can be disabled)
+ Indication of deadlock squares - where boxes should not be pushed (otherwise box can not be pushed to any goal)
+ Position statistics - moves, pushes, box changes e.t.c
+ Counting solved levels and autosave of solutions
+ New levels can be added - game contains 24 levelsets (totally 1700 levels), new levelsets can be loaded in future (supported text format)
+ New skins can be added - supported skins in bmp format
+ Supported levels with unequal number of boxes and goals
- No installer, zip-archive should be manually unpacked and loaded into device
- No autozoom
- Deadlock calculation may be rather slow for large levels (ex. Sasquatch6, level 50 - 35x35 squares)
- Deadlocks prevent autopushing exceeding boxes (only for levels there boxes exceeds goals)
- Designed mostly for QVGA (240x320), also works on other screen resolutions, but status bar can be slightly affected
