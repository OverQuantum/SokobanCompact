SokobanCompact v0.7
05.02.2013

Open source logical game of the Sokoban type for Windows Mobile 6 and compatibles.
Game objective is to move boxes to designated locations, boxes can only be pushed and only one at a time.
(see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)

Features of SokobanCompact:
- Convenient control by stylus/touchscreen - move around a level by 1 click, pushing boxes by 2 clicks
- Control by buttons is also available
- Zoom and scroll - you can solve large levels with normal zoom
- Autozoom only for useful squares of level
- Unlimited undo and redo
- Saving and loading positions
- Animated moving around a level and playing of solutions (can be disabled)
- Indication of deadlock squares - where boxes should not be pushed (otherwise box can not be pushed to any goal)
- Game deadlock indication (i.e. level can not be solved from current position)
- Position statistics - moves, pushes, box changes e.t.c
- Counting solved levels and autosave of solutions
- New levels can be added - game contains 31 levelsets (totally about 1800 levels), new levelsets can be loaded in future (supported text format)
- New skins can be added - supported skins in bmp format and skin sets
- Supported levels with unequal number of boxes and goals

Can be considered as disadvantages:
- No installer, zip-archive should be manually unpacked and loaded into device
- Deadlock calculation may be rather slow for large levels (ex. Sasquatch6, level 50 - 35x35 squares)
- Designed mostly for QVGA (240x320), but works on other screen resolutions

Requirements:
- Windows Mobile 6.0 or compatible (not tested, but may work on Windows Mobile 5.0)
- .NET Compact Framework 2.0
Also works on PC (Windows XP and so on), but graphics is affected
